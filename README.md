A backend service for an interactive fictional pet caf√© where users can play with the pets, buy fruits to feed the pets, and adopt them. Persistence would be added through a relational database to store data such as user inventories (number of fruit and gold in possession), pet health info (happiness and hunger levels). Different interactions with pets satisfy different aspects of their health; playing increases a pet's happiness level, feeding fruit decreases a pet's hunger level (to varying degrees depending on the type of fruit), etc. Users would only be allowed to adopt after attaining a certain level of affinity with the pet, which is built through repeated interactions (playing & feeding) with the pet.
