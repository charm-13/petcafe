1. As someone who loves little creatures but is very allergic to them, I want a game to pet and play with some, and feed them treats.
    *Exception*: Pet doesn't like the treat the user bought them. 
    If the pet doesn't like the treat the user bought, we can tell them what pets at the cafe do like that treat.
    *Exception*: The user tries to buy treats but has insufficient gold.
    Tell the user they need more gold, and they can earn more by interacting with the pets.
    *Exception*: The pet's hunger level is full
    Tell the user they cannot feed that pet anymore, because they are full
2. My parents won't let me get a dog unless I prove to them that I can commit to the dog. I want a game that needs me to interact
   with and feed a pet daily, so that I can prove to my parents that I can take care of a dog.
3. As a user, I want to be able to access my inventory to see how many fruits and how much gold I have.

9. As a frequent player, I want to save my affinity towards each pet and my gold amount so that I can return and continue where I left off.
